Bootable Python VM running kernel script.

To build:
	cd disk
	unzip grub.zip
	unzip c.zip
	cd ..
	make

To run:
	bochs -f bochs/cleese.bxrc


NOTE: The Python interpreter is missing many peices of
functionality. I have been unable to get modules working properly, so
the ISR demo uses functions declared in the builtin module, which
means you can't install a Python handler yet. Seems like some work on
porting the Python interpreter is needed....

The keyboard interrupt will only fire once as you need to strobe the
keyboard in the ISR, and we can't register ISR's yet!
