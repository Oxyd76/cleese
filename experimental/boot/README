This is a very simple example of a bootloader on a floppy booting to a
protected mode kernel on a hard drive.

TO RUN

- uncompress c.img
- You'll need Bochs 2.0.2 installed
- run Bochs from bootp.bxrc
- this will boot the floppy image bootp.img which will, in turn, boot the
  simple kernel on the hard drive image c.img

TO RECOMPILE

- Recompilation of KERNEL.BIN requires djgpp
  (I've had problems with cygwin's gcc)
- type:
    make -f Makefile.djgpp
- if you recompile KERNEL.BIN, copy it to c.img with:
    mtools -c mcopy KERNEL.BIN C:
